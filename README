Code to view quaternionic polytopes in spherical space
with the help of Geomview. 

Written in Objective C. 
It registers new TCL commands so can be used with a script interface. 

However, I know now that there are much better scripting interfaces. 
This code has been superceded by the Symmetriad code. 

If you try to compile it, note that it depends on an old version of Tcl and Tk.
